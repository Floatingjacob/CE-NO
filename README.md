# CENO
Color Encoder, Naturally Original


This was a random idea,
What it does is it converts files to a weird png file that can be decoded back to the original file.


LIBRARIES

You need pillow (pip install pillow)

Run the encoder to encode (duh) the file. If you are encoding large files it may take some time.
Run the decoder to (you guessed it) decode the encoded file back to the original file.




V1.0.1
Made encoding/decoding way faster and more efficent.
